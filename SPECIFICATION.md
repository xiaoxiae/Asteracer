# Specification
The following document contains a specification of the Asteracer simulation, should you wish to implement one in the language of your choice.

## Datatypes and objects
To make sure Asteracer runs in the same way in different languages, **all computations are done strictly using integer datatypes,** which are the following:

- instruction values `InstType: int8`
- position values `PosType: int32`
- speed values `SpeedType: int32`
- size values `SizeType: uint32`

These are then used to define the following objects which we use throughout the simulation:

```python3
class Racer:
    x:  PosType = 0
    y:  PosType = 0
    vx: SpeedType = 0
    vy: SpeedType = 0
    radius: SizeType = 1
```

```python3
class Asteroid:
    x: PosType = 0
    y: PosType = 0
    radius: SizeType = 1
```

```python3
class Goal:
    x: PosType = 0
    y: PosType = 0
    radius: SizeType = 1
```

```python3
class Instruction:
    vx: InstType = 0
    vy: InstType = 0
```

```python3
class BoundingBox:
    min_x: PosType
    min_y: PosType
    max_x: PosType
    max_y: PosType
```

## Simulation
Each tick of the simulation can be separated into the following three steps:

1. **move the racer** using the specified instruction
2. **resolve collisions**
3. **check** if any **goal** is intersected (marking them as such)

These are detailed in the upcoming sections.

_Note 1: for the purpose of optimization, it's advisable to use some kind of a space-partitioning datastructure (like a grid or a K-d tree) for storing asteroids and goals so only a small amount of intersections needs to be checked. Remember to take racer's radius into account._

_Note 2: the integer square root the simulation uses is Python's `math.isqrt`, which is "the floor of the exact square root of n, or equivalently the greatest integer a such that a² ≤ n." Note that python's implementation is exact and does not use floating-point sqrt._

### 1) Moving the racer
Given an instruction `(vx, vy)`, the racer is moved via the following rules:
- slow the racer down by 10%: `racer.velocity = (racer.velocity * 9) // 10`
- add the instruction to the racer's velocity: `racer.velocity += (vx, vy)`
- move the racer using its velocity: `racer.position += racer.velocity`

An instruction is valid only if the squared length of the instruction is no greater than the square of the maximal positive value of the instruction type:
`valid = vx*vx + vy*vy <= 127**2`

### 2) Resolving collisions

Collisions are resolved in `1` to `5` subticks. A subtick check collisions first with asteroids, then with the world bounding box.
If any collision occurs during a subtick, execute another subtick, until the subtick limit is reached.

If any collision occurs in the tick as a whole, reduce the racer's velocity to half. This slowdown must occur at most once per tick, no matter how many collisions happened, as long as any collision happened.

#### Asteroids
Iterate over all asteroids `asteroid` in the order they were added to the simulation and for each:
- if `distance_squared(asteroid, racer) > (asteroid.radius + racer.radius)^2`, we're not colliding (continue to the next asteroid)
- execute the following only upon collision
- let `distance = eucliean_distance(asteroid, racer)` (make sure to use _integer square root_)
- get the vector to push the racer out by: `vn = racer.position - asteroid.position`
- get how much to push by: `push_by = distance - (asteroid.radius + racer.radius)`
- perform the push: `racer.position -= (push_by * vn) / distance`
- **break** the asteroid iteration loop - we only allow one asteroid collision per subtick

#### Bounding box
For each side of the box, if we're colliding (eg. if `racer.x - racer.radius < box.min_x` for the left side), push the racer out to the bounding box edge.
Note that bounding box collisions can occur during a subtick independent of whether an asteroid collision occured.

### 3) Checking goals
Iterate over all goals `goal`, marking them reached if `distance_squared(racer, goal) < (racer.radius + goal.radius)**2` (i.e. if we're intersecting it).
